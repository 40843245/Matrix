# Derivatives
In my notes, I discussed that the differentation, derivative and calculus of matrix. 
But, I still want to remind some important facts.
1. At present, there are many defintion of differentation derivative, and calculus of scalar-to-matrix, vector-to-matrix, and matrix-to-matrix. They are not be generalized.
